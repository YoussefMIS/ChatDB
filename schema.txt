This Assignment_bank database comprises 6 Different entities such as “account”, “account_types”,” branches”, “clients”, “transactions”, “transaction_type”. The following elucidation will expound upon these entities with each attribute and datatypes through the utilization of SQL queries.

An Entity-Relationship diagram is visual representation of the entities, attributes and the relationship between entities within a database. ER diagrams are commonly used in database design and serve as a blueprint for structuring and organizing data. Foreign keys are used to enforce the relationship between the tables. FK are important for maintain data integrity in a relational DB. They ensure that the data in the different tables is consistent. Below are the relationships between tables established using foreign keys:

Account has Branches (N:1): In the DB design, each account is linked with a single branch, and this relationship is mandatory, meaning that every must be associated with a branch. A branch can have multiple accounts, it shows one-to-many relationship between branches and accounts. This connection is established by referencing the Branch_ID column in the Account table to the ID column in the Branches table, ensuring that each account is tied to a specific branch.
Account has account_types (N:1): In the DB schema, it is specified that each account must be linked with one account_type. This relationship is obligatory for each account. Addition, an account type can be associated to multiple accounts, shows a one-to-many 13 relationship between account types and accounts. This bond is established through the reference of the account_type_id column in the account table to the ID column in the
account_Type table, ensuring that each account is categorized under a specific account type.
Clients have Account (N:1): IN the Bank DB, it is mandated that a single client may possess a minimum of one or more accounts, underscoring the potential for multiple accounts per client. Conversely, a single account is exclusively owned by a single customer, exemplifying a many-to-one relationship between account and clients. This relation is achieved by referencing the client_id column in the Account table to the “ID” column in the client table, thereby ensuring the presence of a valid client association for every account, with the constraints that it cannot be null.
Transactions source account (N:1): Within the database architecture, it is established that a single account can conduct numerous transactions, signifying the potential for multiple transactions per account. In addition, each individual transaction is exclusively attributed to a single account, indicating a many-to-one relationship between
transactions and accounts. This linkage is accomplished by referring to the source_account_id column in the Transaction table, which is directly associated with the ID column in the Account table.
Transactions Destination account (N:1): In the DB schema, it is evident that a single account can accommodate multiple incoming transactions, illustrating the potential for numerous transactions to be directed to a single account. Conversely, each transaction is related to accounts, underscoring a many-to-one relationship between transactions and the account table. This connection is solidified through the reference of the destination_account_id column in the Transaction table, which points to the ID column in the Account table.
Transactions has Transaction_types(N:1): In the database design, it is established that each transaction is related with a single transaction type, it illustrates a one-to-many relationship between transaction types and transaction table. Furthemore, a transaction type can be associated to more than one transaction, it shows a many-to-one relationship between these two tables. This connects the reference of the Transaction_type_ID column in the Transaction table to the ID column in the Transaction_type table.
